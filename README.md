# Pikakid98 Launcher Updater
A simple program to update my launcher automatically (v2.0 SHOULD in theory be fine with your AV.. If not then replace your AV.. It's shit)

<h1>Building Instructions</h1>

[Portableapps.com Launcher](https://portableapps.com/apps/development/portableapps.com_launcher)
to create the .exe
###### {Just download it and when running select the folder where you have the src. Keep in mind you need to have the folder where the "App" folder is. Not the App folder itself. That won't work}

<h1>Windows User Warning</h1>

I'm not sure what is causing it but it may have something to do with your Microsoft account being attatched to your PC. But sometimes if your PC's name or Microsoft account name (idk) differs from your account name then you may find a second user account created to store the downloads. Unfortunately, this is something that I can't fix.

###### I forgot to do one for v2.0.1.. Sorry not sorry.. I only did this because some people are paranoid.. Also the installer's detections are false positives
