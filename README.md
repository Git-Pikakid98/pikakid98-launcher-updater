<h1>Windows User Warning</h1>

I'm not sure what is causing it but it may have something to do with your Microsoft account being attatched to your PC. But sometimes if your PC's name or Microsoft account name (idk) differs from your account name then you may find a second user account created to store the downloads. Unfortunately, this is something that I can't fix.
